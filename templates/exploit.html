    <h4>YOU HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED!.. jk</h4>
    <br><br>
    <h5>You are seeing this page because you triggered a social media fingerprint exploit hidden on this website's
        home page. This type of exploit relies on the very common functionality that most platforms have of
        redirecting already logged-in users to another page, using the "next" url query parameter, whenever they
        land on the login page. By embedding this query in the "src" property of a hidden media file, the exploiter
        can determine if the user is logged into a third-party service and trigger an event accordingly, just like
        this redirection.
        <br><br>
        One way of preventing this security/privacy threat is to always serve media content from a different dedicated
        domain, such as a CDN. Closer inspection of the home page of this website will show that, in fact, it contains two
        hidden exploits. They are almost identical, the only difference is that the first one tries to access the
        favicon being served by the local server, which is successful, and it is the one that brought you here. The
        second one, however, tries to access the favicon being served by a CDN, which fails, since it is in a different
        domain.
